Read on if you're interested in learning about my process.

## Design
I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to explore some different design directions.

## Development
I used [Chartist](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js) to get started with the bar chart. This was an early version that didn't have all of the styling applied yet.

I tweaked the styling, so you can see that I'm getting closer to the design here, but the y-axis doesn't behave the way I want it to yet.

There we go. I fixed the y-axis so that it goes by twos and also has a bigger max value.

This was a test to see if I could add a custom shape to the top of the bar. Rather than spending time to design out the trophy image at this stage, I just made a simple polygon that I could then replace later.

## Animation
Now on to the fun part!
I first tried having the bars appear in sequence.

I ended up not liking that, so I did a different take with the bars appearing all at the same time.
